Important points to take into account:

1. The Cypress.json was modified for optimal behavior on my personal screen, it is possible that the test will show errors due to the screen in which case you must modify the values ​​inside Cypress.json to fit the screen size you are working on, you could also delete those values ​​directly.

2. It should be taken into account that some steps will fail because there are errors on the page and the corresponding Bugs were raised

3. To correctly view the uploaded Bugs you must install a PDF extension in your Visual Studio Code or in the code editor of your choice.
If you can't see it, go directly to the file in the explorer and open it directly from the folder.
